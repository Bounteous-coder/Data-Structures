This is a program I made for solving a maze. The program will receive as input a file with a description of the maze, and it will produce as output a path from the entrance to the exit, if any exists. 
A maze consists of a set of rooms connected by corridors, some of which are closed by doors. 
To open a door a number of coins between 0 and 9 are needed. Each door has associated a number that indicates how
many coins are needed to open it. 
The program will be given a number of coins that it can use to open doors while trying to solve the maze.
Each coin can be used only once. Imagine that the doors have coin slots where the correct number of coins must be deposited for opening the door. Once the coins are placed inside the slot they cannot be reused.
My program will store the maze as an undirected graph. 
Every node of the graph corresponds to a room, and every edge corresponds to either a corridor that can be used to go from one room to another or to a door that the program might decide to open. 
There are two special nodes in this graph corresponding to the entrance and the exit. 
A modified depth first search traversal, for example, can be used to find a solution for the maze.
